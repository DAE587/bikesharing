# Overview:

The purpose of this analysis is to analyze CityBike usage trends in New York City for the month of August 2019 to determine if it would be a successful business in Des Moines Iowa. The data was obtained from the Citybike website, and then modified in Python to obtain additional features, such as changing the dates to include date time so we could drill down to month, days, and hours in analyzing the trip duration information. We then created a tableau story to visualize the analysis based on trip duration and usage.
